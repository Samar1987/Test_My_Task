PromotionEngine .NET Core C# Console application =>


IMPORTENT: This is console (an exe) application, developed on .NET Core with Unit Test cases in C# programing language by implementing 2 design patterns (1) Composit pattern and (2) Interface Repository pattern. This app can be run on any plateform like Windows. Mac, Linux etc.


Promotion Engine Console Application Description =>

(A) This application is currently having 3 Promotion types classes. But based upon business requirement we can add more promotion types without interacting\modifying an end user iterface of this application.
